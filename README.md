# Getting Started

Firstly, set up a Haskell development environment by following the steps [here](https://www.haskell.org/ghcup/install/#how-to-install)

After setting up an environment and restarting the terminal, you can validate that everything is working by running `ghci` in the command line. A REPL will open and you can write some random Haskell expression for it to compute (for example, `2 + 2`). You can exit the REPL by writing `:quit`.

Next, you can compile the program by writing `ghc topic5assignment.hs`. (Note that the generated files are not checked into Git because our systems are different). You can then run the program by running `./topic5assignment`.
